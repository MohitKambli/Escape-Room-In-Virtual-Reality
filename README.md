# Escape-Room-In-Virtual-Reality
<h1>Escape Room In Virtual Reality</h1>
<p>Escape Room is a mobile VR application which has horror effects such as zombies, laser beams etc. to make the game interesting. The health bar which decreases on collision with such effects, is also an important asset.</p>
<p>The puzzle defining process is a step-in game design which focuses on the main goal of the project. The puzzle should be designed in such a way that the application of theoretical concepts is used to drive through room. Students need to push their limits to think about the solution of the puzzles. Puzzles introduced in this game are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Picking up key from the room of a specified color: </b>In this puzzle, the student has to search for a key of specified color in order to hop into the next room. This puzzle covers a basic “select” query that is present in database concepts.</li>
  <li><b>Popping the blue balls, and pushing the red balls: </b>The concept involved in this example is stack, which has two operations of push and pop. The written clue or puzzle inside the room will give a hint about it. Students need to crack the hint and should take out (pop) blue balls of the mug and should put (push) red balls into it.</li>
  <li><b>Selecting the correct door that wraps the IP: </b>This puzzle consists of a specific IP that belongs to a particular class. Students have to determine the correct class that IP belongs to and go for that door. If the answer is incorrect, then he has to face the circumstances, that is, either get a massive hit by burning in fire, or by falling down.</li>
